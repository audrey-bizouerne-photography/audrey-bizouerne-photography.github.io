              I am very excited about sharing this new series as it's not every day you get to photograph a stunning woman naked. It was a first for me and I am eternally grateful to Raquel for giving me the opportunity to do it. She was the perfect model. Aortarota, you are a gift. It obviously made me want to do more so you know who to talk to if it tickles your fancy...
              Publishing a series of nudes however raised a lot of questions regarding guidelines on social media, especially here on Instagram. I'll go back to this in details later.
              So let's make a soft start to avoid early censorship: this first photo doesn't involve nudity apart from bare skull and shoulders. Reflection photography is always fun to work on so I'm glad we got a good one.

                    Raquel brought a shiny wedding dress and a soft toy she wanted to play with. She put on this glorious crumpled dress and started playing with her bunny. I like the contrast between the two photographs. The first reflects something quite pure and innocent yet fierce in her eyes. The second one shows something more childish and playful. It reinforces the ambivalence of her persona, how versatile and beautiful she can be. I loved witnessing her letting go completely, not bothered by the camera for one second although being fully aware of my presence.

          Here she took off the top of her dress and faced me while on her hands and knees. I love how photogenic her shaved head and small forehead scar look. Her pose is brilliant, the first one especially where she looks like she has turned herself into a praying mantis.

            At that point we had to make a decision regarding the nudity knowing it would be an issue on Instagram. First I thought about blurring her nipples in a subtle way to hide the least possible but then I thought we should make it a statement by using something very visible. I knew she meant to draw some bugs for her EP artwork so I suggested we use them to cover the body parts Instagram wouldn't allow. We then agreed on showing the uncensored ones here, so here they are.

        This statement made it clear we again had to cover Raquel's nipples to be able to present Aortarota's majestic nudity. I'm so glad my first nude portraits were with her. She was the ideal model. Totally at ease with her body, no inhibition whatsoever and very playful with the camera. I love her enthusiasm, pleased and excited to try any idea and always going for it with no hesitation. A pleasure to shoot. I like how forward she looks. Facing the camera and straight in the eye. Bare naked. No need to do much but just be who you are and look at the camera. We could have used subtle angles to create good shapes and lines, but we thought we should do it plain and simple. It's not even something we discussed beforehand, it just happened naturally. The only thing Raquel wanted to keep was the bunny to cover her genitals which makes it even more provoking and flirtatious.

        The second one was actually shot as a bit of a joke. We called it the 'Instagram one'. But we still wanted to have a plain one, exposing her breasts fully. I felt somewhat intimidated by her outright self-confidence. If only I could have had that at her age! I'm glad I was able to capture it. Raquel, don't change, you're amazing.

        When I met Raquel a while back now, it was at one of my gigs and she enjoyed my band's music a lot. I saw her a few times when I was playing afterwards, and we started talking more and more. A year or so later, she became Aortarota. I was very excited to listen to her music since she had been so supportive of mine. I was immediately impressed by her charisma and authenticity. Her visual identity online was so strong from the start. You could see her growing into a complete musician so rapidly. Soon she started putting on all her makeup to embody a puzzling sad clown. I loved it. It suits her so well. I asked her how it felt wearing the makeup, assuming that embodying someone else boosted her confidence. She explained she never felt more herself than with the makeup on. The makeup was her. The makeup is her.
        When she told me about her EP cover idea, I smiled and immediately thought, 'How odd. I'm in.' She wanted a portrait of herself naked on the toilet. We then had to figure out a way to stage it. We tried different angles and perspectives and, although it was not our favourite to begin with, this one became an obvious choice after a bit of thinking. There's something in her posture that I first wasn't too sure about at first because she contorted herself into an unnatural position. We quickly realised it actually revealed who she is, because she would just contort herself all the way through the shoot without even thinking about it. So that was the cover sorted really quickly. Again, for censorship reasons, she worked her artwork around her nudity to be able to post her music on Spotify and iTunes.
        The first photo is the original one and the second is her EP cover. I highly recommend you give her a follow and listen to her music.

        Achieving a good reflection in the mirror is not so easy. In the first photo, Raquel wasn't actually looking in the mirror and could neither see me nor herself at all. I'm glad we finally found the right angle by the millimetre giving the illusion that she was looking at herself, and her reflection back at me.

          It might be a detail but keeping the dress unironed made the texture on the black and white photo interesting and gave depth to the photograph. Just saying for those who hate ironing clothes, there might be a reason not to (am I talking to myself here?).
        </li>

        <li>
        I don't know how many times I used my dark blue Ikea blanket to fake a black background but a lot! DIY again and forever. All these photos were taken in my flat so I could see once again how having to work with limited possibilities created unexpected results. You can even see the edge of the blanket on one photo. I first thought I would cover it but now I quite like it because it looks more authentic.
