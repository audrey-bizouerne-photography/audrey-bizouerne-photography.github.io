        <p>
        Soon after joining my friend Alex Neilson's band Alex Rex, I wanted to take some photos of him in different stagings to try and decipher his solo extravaganza. We talked about a few ideas and decided to give them a try one afternoon at a professional studio.
        Alex told me he wanted to do a photo with a dog inspired by the famous photo Terry O'Neill took of David Bowie with a jumping dog, initially for the Diamond Dogs album. I find this series fascinating so I was more than happy to accept the challenge.
        The first step was to find the right dog. I was lucky enough to know Mr Red, the most beautiful and massive dog walking up and down Otago Lane. I set up a date with his owner Angy, booked the studio, and asked my dream team to join us: Hannah to assist me, and Claudia for the make up. They stayed with us all day and made this possible so thank you all so much for getting involved.
        Alex met Mr Red once ahead of the shoot so the two of them would get to know each other. He loves dogs so he never seemed intimidated by this dog whose head is twice his size. The look between them two is pretty funny and tender. They played the game so well it didn't take them long to feel at ease. A few sniffs and that was it!

          I've never really liked the conventional portraits you do at a photographer's studio. You should smile but not too much, wear something nice but not too flamboyant, and act natural, whatever that means. And yet, this is exactly what I wanted to achieve here precisely because I knew that photographing a dog in a studio couldn't turn out to be that conventional. After Alex and Mr Red had a bit of time getting to know each other, they were ready to strike the pose. Alex was brave enough to let the massive dog go all over him and I love the sense of complicity that came out of it. Mr Red was so keen on being the centre of attention. His presence was so striking - he just took over the whole room. Standing on his hind legs to play with his toy, sniffing around everywhere, getting closer and closer to Alex, never staying still for more than a few seconds. Well done Alex, we can barely notice the tornado around you. Thank you for playing the game so keenly!

                I could have binned this series but for some reason it shows what I like the most in a shoot: unexpected photos. I shot a lot with a fast shutter speed because the dog was moving all the time. I tried to take as many as I could, knowing that time was limited - I didn't want Mr Red to get too tired. So what happened was that the flash didn't always have time to trigger between shots. I really like these dark photos as you can only see the silhouette of a man and a dog. It feels like there's a story there. I kept the original frame to show something more natural, like some sort of 'behind the scenes' photos.

                    This series shows Mr Red and his owner Angy. I wanted to thank her by showing a few photos of their sweet duo. There is not much to say, I think the photos speak for themselves. No need to act, Angy and Mr Red were naturals, and I was happy to immortalize this moment to show the love between them. Thanks again Angy for making this happen.

                I named this last one in honour of Alex's love for Greek mythology. This photograph gave me a lot to think about. The unusual expression on Alex's face is quite perplexing. I am still not sure today what crossed his mind at that exact second. What I am sure of is that Mr Red chose that exact second to get so close to Alex he gave the photo the best composition I could hope for. Mr Red gives Alex a sense of majesty, adding to the realm of his Alex Rex persona. The more I look at this photo, the more I like it and find it relevant and true to what I see in Alex. There's a sense of oblivion and vulnerability here that doesn't appear in any other photograph, and that is also anchored in a strong statement of power.

      <h6>TECHNICAL NOTES:</h6>
      <br><br>
      <small>
      <ul>
        <li>Prior to the shoot, I had to do a bit of research to wrap my head around the practicality of keeping a dog indoors with lights flashing for a couple of hours. I read that Bowie's dog barked every time the lights flashed during the shoot, so I was dreading it would happen to us too. But Mr Red didn't bark once. Angy was very patient, and guided her dog perfectly. We were lucky to have such a good dog in the studio.
        I also remember reading that Terry O'Neill had to put meat above the dog's head to make him jump. Angy told me she just needed Mr Red's favourite toy, which happened to be a green aloe vera plastic bottle! Who could have known? This dog was of simple pleasures. In the end, Mr Red took tremendous poses thanks to the incredible trust and love for his owner. But he didn't jump!</li>
        <li>Remember a dog this size dribbles a hell of a lot, and needs water regularly. Mr Red was drinking water by pints and the amount of saliva we all got on our clothes was significant. I had to edit the dribble out on a few photos so that your attention wouldn't get distracted by a bit of slobber on boots and shirts.</li>
