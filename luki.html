          Here's a series of photos I did for Lucy Duncan aka Luki.
          Lucy and I became friends as soon as we met in early 2019, after a few parties and gigs.
          When I borrowed some studio lights from my friend Hannah, I was hoping to practice shooting indoors. I thought I could use my flat and asked Lucy to come along for my first experiment. She was very excited about the idea and accepted straight away. She brought different outfits and a couple of wigs and there we were, turning my flat upside down and dancing to Kate Bush.
      <br><br>
          The first one above we called 'The Floating Head' or 'Guillotine for Luki' – whichever you prefer. Lucy had this beige jacket with a black lining. It’s when she started playing with her clothes that the magic happened: a disembodied face. There's no montage here and I promise I didn't chop off Lucy's head! Her wig accentuated the contrast as well and converting the photo into black and white made her face pop out distinctly. Luki has been using it for promotion purposes.

        </div>

        <p>
          This one was part of our first selection but has been discarded since. Taking a look at the photos for the thousandth time, I thought it would be worth putting it back here. I love Lucy's expression on this one. It’s the same kind of expression as in the first one, there's an undeniable sweetness and delicacy on Lucy's face. I think there's a sense of peace coming from this one. It's another floating head photo but here, with a predominance of white, it made me think she was on a different planet, although I know she was in my kitchen!

        <p>
          I can call this one 'The Monochrome Ghost'. I wasn't sure about it at first because of the fuzziness on her face, but then I remembered not to judge my photos too quickly. After a while I started to see something gentle and relevant thanks to her expression and movements. After a couple of spins of 'Wuthering Heights', Lucy started to dance softly, moving her hands around her body without looking away from me. I liked her focus. I thought I should try to convert it into black and white as well and that's when it appeared: the ghost behind her. This strange shadow was not on the colour version at all and I could not tell where it came from or what it was. It couldn't have come from the artificial light or from me so what was it? After examining it for a bit with Hannah, we both concluded it must have been the natural light coming from my window. But the studio lights were too bright to make that happen. And why would it only appear in black and white? It will remain a mystery. I still believe it was a ghost. Unless you can think of something else?

        This last series above was shot in my kitchen hence its name 'Lucy in the Kitchen Sky'. This happened towards the end of the shoot. You can picture us moving the furniture around, trying to find the right angle for my piano in a square recess in my kitchen. I tried to squeeze in these two big lights behind my stove and cleared the room to leave space to Lucy and the piano. We tried simple shots with her sitting at the piano, then we started shooting in different positions, leaving space around the piano so that Lucy could stand wherever she wanted. Leaning on the piano from behind, sitting on top of it and playing with her toes or our favourite pose, lying on the piano holding my lightbulb. I love how ideas come up by trying different things. Not knowing what can result from a shoot is so exciting. When the image starts to build up in my head and then before my eyes, it is a great feeling. This photo is the main press picture Luki has been using to promote her single 'The Parts' / 'The Empty Arms'. Thanks Lucy for being such a good pal to photograph, listening and trying out every crazy idea for the sake of art. It's what your music inspires me to be: bold!

      <h6>TECHNICAL NOTES:</h6>
      <br><br>
      <small>
      <ul>
        <li>Let me give you a trick: I strongly recommend listening to Kate Bush while taking photos. The result is magic. I'm pretty sure she's the one who conjured up the ghost. </li>
        <li>I remember Hannah warning me about trying too many things in one shoot. She advised me to stick to a couple of ideas to avoid being overwhelmed with too many different setups or shots after the session. I didn't realise at the time and was so excited about my first trial that I shot until Lucy and I were too tired to carry on. I ended up shooting more than 1100 photos in 3 hours! Never again! It took me such a long time to decide which to use and I sometimes still question my choices. Lesson learned!</li>
