          13.04.18/13.04.20. Two years ago today I hired a public swimming pool in Glasgow for a couple of hours. I wanted to make an old dream of mine come true: shooting underwater.
          The outcome was more than I expected. Two record covers resulted from this unique experience.
          I had started taking photography seriously at the time but I was not very confident in my photo skills. So I decided to challenge myself with something physically demanding so that the technical result would only be what my body could take. Basically I was trying to hide my lack of technique under the constraints of a difficult environment. I was thinking of a photo for a single cover for my band Rev Magnetic so I needed a female model. I asked my pals Hairband to join me. I thought that if the session was fairly successful, they could maybe use the photos for their band as well.

        </div>

        <p class="text-justify">
          This first photo is the cover Hairband ended up choosing for their first EP, released October 19th on <a href="https://www.monorailmusic.com/" target="_blank" id="anchor">Monorail Music</a>. The second one you see here is the photo before I cropped it square to make it into a cover. I want to thank Michael Kasparis and Alexis Anne for the layout and design on this beautiful artwork.
          If you look closely you might notice five people but only four bodies. Well, look at the second photo and you'll understand why. Emma's body (on the far right) suddenly appears on the original photo as the water distorted their bodies and shifted them to the right so the crop deleted Emma's body (sorry Emma!).

        Above are individual photos of Hairband. The first five (Emma, Rowan, Rachel, Simone and Sephi) are featured in the inner sleeve of their EP. The last three of Rowan, Sephi and Simone are a wee bonus which has not been used for the artwork but that I really liked.
        I think the most difficult part about taking photos underwater is that you don't realise you can't stay still underwater. You have to move your arms and feet or you'll float! So how do you do that with a camera?
        Secondly, you're asking your pals to go underwater, but they have to wait for a few seconds before they do so that you can get ready. I can tell you it's very hard to synchronize and not to panick when you're fully dressed underwater knowing that someone is taking a photo of you. Thank you Simone, Rowan, Sephi, Rachel and Emma for being so patient and resilient while repeating the same movement, I realise how difficult it was.

    These four photos could be called 'The Slint Series' for obvious reasons. Although I wasn't thinking about the cover of the classic Slint album 'Spiderland' during the shoot, I kept it in mind afterwards and converted the photos to black and white to give them more of a moody vibe. Call it a nod to the famous cover!
    I think my friend and photo teacher Hannah arrived not long before so you can tell she helped the girls relax, diverting their attention and directing the shoot a little bit. I realised how hard it was to lead people from behind a camera. It was my first experience as such in a photo shoot and doing it with friends, though I felt I was in good hands, put me in a strange position. What helped in this series is that the girls stayed above water so they could speak and forget about me. I played with their reflection and moved around as I didn't need them to do anything. You can see them laugh which was great because it felt a bit like a break for everyone. After bodiless heads today, guess what we're going to see tomorrow...

    <p class="text-justify">
    It took me a long time to finish this project, from thinking about the concept to booking the pool, organizing the shoot, buying the equipment, finding the team, shooting, choosing, selecting, editing and finally posting. Five people to shoot is a lot, five people to shoot in a pool is challenging to say the least.
    The frustration I felt sometimes was that some of the photos looked great but there was always something, someone, a detail, a look, a closed eye, focus, synchronization, frame, that was not quite right.
    I guess the photo above was probably the easiest one. I like its simplicity and grace.
    After showing heads with no bodies, I wanted to show bodies with no heads. There's a lightness that is pleasant to watch. It looks like some of them are almost floating or flying. I liked the diversity of their outfits - tights, no tights, a yellow dress, a glittery top and a pearl necklace! Hairband used this photograph for one of their tour posters.

    <p class="text-justify">

    I'll finish presenting this project by showing my two favourites. This particular one struck me immediately. The imperfection of it creates some kind of perfection to the composition. The randomness of the poses, the grace of the movements. Everything about it makes sense to me. It shows again how difficult it was to have everyone underwater at the exact same second. I really like that they're not all underwater actually, it creates something quite special.

    <p class="text-justify">
      This last one is possibly my favourite. Rachel's pose is what makes the whole composition and therefore a great band photo. The white glasses also give a wee bit of a Nirvana touch. Again, not on purpose, but didn't Kurt Cobain wear the same glasses somewhere? Nevermind... <br>
      This time, I managed to have them all underwater at the same time and I love how their bodies express something totally different from one to the other. It makes me think of a sci-fi painting. What do you think?
      My first story is now finished. Thanks for following and reading it. There will be more underwater photography later on as this successful photo shoot led to another cover, Rev Magnetic's debut album. Another story to tell...

      <h6>TECHNICAL NOTES:</h6>
      <br><br>
      <small>
      <ul>
        <li>I did some research to find a waterproof bag for DSLR cameras and ended up impulsively buying a cheap one on eBay. Because I didn't have the budget for anything expensive and I didn't own a GoPro or anything similar, I set up my DIY equipment, putting socks in the bag so the camera didn't move. The bag was an average size for digital cameras so it didn't quite fit. </li>
        <li>I was using a snorkel but I had to get rid of it a few times because I couldn't always stay close to the surface. I had to coil my feet around the poles of the ladder to try and stay still. It hurt! I was also using a mask since I wear contact lenses so I couldn't have opened my eyes underwater without it! </li>
        <li>Prior to the shoot, I looked at diving torches online, knowing there wouldn't be any lights underwater and I bought a cheap small one. I asked Hannah to come along to assist me and she helped by aiming the torch at the subjects to make up for the dim light of that late afternoon. She used it above water but the girls also used it under a few times. This wee bit of extra light helped massively.</li>
